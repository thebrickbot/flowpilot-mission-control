# OpenClaw Mission Control

[![CI](https://github.com/abhi1693/openclaw-mission-control/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/abhi1693/openclaw-mission-control/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Join-Slack-active?style=flat&color=blue&link=https%3A%2F%2Fjoin.slack.com%2Ft%2Foc-mission-control%2Fshared_invite%2Fzt-3qpcm57xh-AI9C~smc3MDBVzEhvwf7gg)

OpenClaw Mission Control is the centralized operations and governance platform for running OpenClaw across teams and organizations, with unified visibility, approval controls, and gateway-aware orchestration.
It gives operators a single interface for work orchestration, agent and gateway management, approval-driven governance, and API-backed automation.

## Platform overview

Mission Control is designed to be the day-to-day operations surface for OpenClaw.
Instead of splitting work across multiple tools, teams can plan, execute, review, and audit activity in one system.

Core operational areas:

- Work orchestration: manage organizations, workstreams, boards, tasks, and tags.
- Agent operations: create, inspect, and manage agent lifecycle from a unified control surface.
- Governance and approvals: route sensitive actions through explicit approval flows.
- Gateway management: connect and operate gateway integrations for distributed environments.
- Activity visibility: review a timeline of system actions for faster debugging and accountability.
- API-first model: support both web workflows and automation clients from the same platform.

## Use cases

- Multi-team agent operations: run multiple boards and workstreams across organizations from a single control plane.
- Human-in-the-loop execution: require approvals before sensitive actions and keep decision trails attached to work.
- Distributed runtime control: connect gateways and operate remote execution environments without changing operator workflow.
- Audit and incident review: use activity history to reconstruct what happened, when it happened, and who initiated it.
- API-backed process integration: connect internal workflows and automation clients to the same operational model used in the UI.

## What makes Mission Control different

- Operations-first design: built for running agent work reliably, not just creating tasks.
- Governance built in: approvals, auth modes, and clear control boundaries are first-class.
- Gateway-aware orchestration: built to operate both local and connected runtime environments.
- Unified UI and API model: operators and automation act on the same objects and lifecycle.
- Team-scale structure: organizations, workstreams, boards, tasks, tags, and users in one system of record.

## Who it is for

- Platform teams running OpenClaw in self-hosted or internal environments.
- Operations and engineering teams that need clear approval and auditability controls.
- Organizations that want API-accessible operations without losing a usable web UI.

## Get started in minutes

### Option A: One-command production-style bootstrap

If you haven't cloned the repo yet, you can run the installer in one line:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abhi1693/openclaw-mission-control/master/install.sh | bash
```

If you already cloned the repo:

```bash
./install.sh
```

The installer is interactive and will:

- Ask for deployment mode (`docker` or `local`).
- Install missing system dependencies when possible.
- Generate and configure environment files.
- Bootstrap and start the selected deployment mode.

Installer support matrix: [`docs/installer-support.md`](./docs/installer-support.md)

### Option B: Manual setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker Engine
- Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose`)

### 1. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Before startup:

- Set `LOCAL_AUTH_TOKEN` to a non-placeholder value (minimum 50 characters) when `AUTH_MODE=local`.
- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is reachable from your browser.

### 2. Start Mission Control

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yml --env-file .env up -d --build
```

### 3. Open the application

- Mission Control UI: http://localhost:3000
- Backend health: http://localhost:8000/healthz

### 4. Stop the stack

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yml --env-file .env down
```

## Authentication

Mission Control supports two authentication modes:

- `local`: shared bearer token mode (default for self-hosted use)
- `clerk`: Clerk JWT mode

Environment templates:

- Root: [`.env.example`](./.env.example)
- Backend: [`backend/.env.example`](./backend/.env.example)
- Frontend: [`frontend/.env.example`](./frontend/.env.example)

## Documentation

Complete guides for deployment, production, troubleshooting, and testing are in [`/docs`](./docs/).

## Project status

Mission Control is under active development.

- Features and APIs may change between releases.
- Validate and harden your configuration before production use.
